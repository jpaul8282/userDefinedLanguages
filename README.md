# Notepad++ User Defined Languages Collection

Notepad++ supports around 80 programming languages for syntax highlighting & folding.  For languages that are not in the list of languages with built-in support, someone may have created a User Defined Language (UDL) for adding syntax highlighting to the language and added it to this collection, or you can submit a UDL to this collection for others to use. 

To learn all about User Defined Languages:

Here is the UDL list and from where you can download:

## Using a UDL from this Collection

For now, you have to manually install a new User Defined Language.

1. Download the XML file from the [`UDL list`](./udl-list.md) of this Collection.
2. Import the file by placing the file in your `userDefineLangs` folder and restarting Notepad++.  (It is also possible to use the User Defined Language dialog box to **Import** your file, but that places the UDL in the combined file, which is more complicated to maintain).  More details of what those steps entail can be found in the ["Import a UDL" section](https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/user-defined-language-system/#import-a-udl) of the official documentation.

## Submitting your UDL to the Collection

You can submit your UDL file(s) into this repo, or a (some) link(s) to where your UDL file(s) is (are) hosted.
In both cases, you have to do a Pull Request on this repository. 

More information about submitting your UDL to the Collection, please refer to:

https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/userDefinedLanguages/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

We populated the initial UDLs in this Collection based on the old NppWiki++ list of UDLs (archived at [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20180814202307/http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/User_Defined_Language_Files))

The original author of any UDL in this Collection may [request](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/userDefinedLanguages/issues) that we remove it from the Collection (or submit a PR to do the same), and we will oblige.
